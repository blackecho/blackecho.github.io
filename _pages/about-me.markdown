The most effective way to actually learn something is by teaching it. I really love teaching, because it forces me to understand things at a deeper level and to communicate efficiently with others.
But sometimes is diffucult to find people willing to learn about the latest Machine Learning algorithm that I studied, or about my thoughts and opinions about AI and related stuff.
So, why not open a blog?
I hope that I will improve my skills by writing this blog.

A little bit about me. I'm a graduate student of "Master in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics" in Rome, Italy. I'm deeply interested in everything that has something to do with AI/Machine Learning, Computer Science, Robotics, Psychology and many other things. In my spare time I like reading, do side projects and hang out with friends. I'm writing this blog with the hope that it may be helpful for somebody, if you find something wrong or if you simply want to connect with me, please contact me, I would be glad to connect with you!

This blog is a collection of articles mainly about Artificial Intelligence, and other topics related to them. There are some articles describing in detail a specific topic or algorithm, and some articles about my personal projects and my opinions about stuff. All the code that I provide to better explain something is free to use and modify and you can reuse it at your will, just let me know if you improve it. I'm writing this blog for several reasons, the first of all is obviously because is fun! Another reason is that I really think that the best way to actually learn something is by teaching it, so I decided to start writing this blog to have someone listening to my crazy things :)

The other reason is that I hope that someone will find the material in this site helpful to understand better these subjects and to be more passionate about AI! So feel free to take a look around, and don't hesitate to contact me for whatever reason, I will be glad to reply as soon as I can!

The software powering this blog is written by me. I wrote it using Python and Flask, which I think is just an awesome framework! If you want to see the code of have more details about this, i'll be glad to discuss with you about that.

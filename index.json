[{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi, I'm Gabriele! A software engineer and rock climbing addict on a journey to location independence.\nI have been living in London for the past couple of years, working on self-driving cars at Lyft. I was enjoying my life there, but I've always had this inner need to experience more of the beauty the world has to offer. That's why I left my job and embarked on this journey to become location independent. Or digital nomad, as they call it these days.\nI was never a big traveller. I never left Europe until I was 26, when I went to India. Then Indonesia this year, and after that it was a matter of time before I would leave everything and give it a shot.\nWhen not programming, I spend my time either climbing or searching for the best coffee out there. Also, you can often find me trying to cook some exotic asian dish.\nI use this blog to share thoughts and blabbering about software engineering topics. I hope you will learn something from it. If you do, I would love to hear about it.\nAlso, I'm available for hiring!\n","permalink":"https://gabrieleangeletti.github.io/about/about/","tags":null,"title":"About Me"}]

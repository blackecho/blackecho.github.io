This is a blog about Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Computer Science and related topics.
Some posts describe in detail a specific topic or algorithm, and some posts are about my personal projects and my opinions about stuff. All the code that I provide to better explain something is free to use and modify and you can reuse it at your will, just let me know if you improve it.
I'm writing this blog for several reasons. The first is obviously because is fun! Another reason is that I really think that the best way to actually learn something is by teaching it, so I decided to start writing this blog in an attempt to have someone to teach things.

I hope that someone will find the material in this site helpful to better understand these subjects and to be more passionate about AI! Don't hesitate to contact me for whatever reason, I will be glad to reply as soon as I can!

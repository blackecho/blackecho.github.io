    <p>Somewhere I read that the most effective way to actually learn something is by teaching it. I really love teaching, because it forces me to understand things at a deeper level and to communicate efficiently with others.
But I have one problem, I haven’t enough people around me willing to learn about the latest Machine Learning algorithm that I studied, or about my mental masturbations about AI and singularity. So I thought, why not open a blog? I always wanted to have a blog, but always told me that I didn’t have the time for it, I would do that next year, etc..
Now I finally convinced myself to do it, so I hope that you will find it useful, and that i will improve my teaching skills by writing a blog :)</p>

<p>Now a little bit of what i’m doing right now. I’m a graduate student of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics in Rome, Italy. I’m deeply interested in everything that has something to do with AI/Machine Learning, Robotics, Psychology and many other things. In my spare time I like hang out with friends, reading and cooking (if you want some good italian recipe, just ask me). I’m writing this blog with the hope that it may be helpful for somebody, if you find something wrong or if you simply want to connect with me, please contact me, I would be glad to connect with you!</p>
